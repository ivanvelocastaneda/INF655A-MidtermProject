The Midterm Project displays a simple web application that allows users to browse and search for different types of products, in this case, adidas and nike products. 

#Table of contents
Home page: This page display a list of all the products available for sale.
Product detail page: This page should display the details of a single product, including its name, description, and price (Still a work in progress but the component is built within the project)
Search page: This page should allow users to search for products by name or category (still a work in progress but the component is built within the project, there is just a few errors). 
Cart page: This page should display a list of products that the user has added to their cart.

#Requirements
Not requirements are needed, just extensive knowledge about ReactJs, components, props, state, prop drilling, forms(which I did not get to do in this project), navigation, and css styling


#Problems you may encounter during this project
When you click on a link, the path is modified correctly but it stays on the same page until it is refreshed. Once refreshed, the right page is shown.
When you add an item to the cart, you cannot access the cart but you can still see the number of items that the cart contains(this problem is related to the previous problem)
The search page and products page are incomplete. The search page raises an error that pertains to using the find() function.
